Comment Tagger
==============

The *Comment Tagger* plugin lets logged-in readers tag comments. The plugin is intended to work with [*CommentPress Core*](https://wordpress.org/plugins/commentpress-core/) but can (with some effort) be used elsewhere. Please bear in mind that this plugin is at an early stage of development.

## Installation ##

### GitHub ###

There are two ways to install from GitHub:

#### ZIP Download ####

If you have downloaded *Comment Tagger* as a ZIP file from the GitHub repository, do the following to install and activate the plugin and theme:

1. Unzip the .zip file and, if needed, rename the enclosing folder so that the plugin's files are located directly inside `/wp-content/plugins/comment-tagger`
2. Activate the plugin
3. You are done!

#### git clone ####

If you have cloned the code from GitHub, it is assumed that you know what you're doing.
